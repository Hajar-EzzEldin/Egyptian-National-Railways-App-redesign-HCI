## 1. Project Overview
Egyptian Railways is a mobile application that allows users to search for train trips, book tickets, and manage their journeys.

The project focused on a full UI/UX redesign of the application, covering all core screens involved in the booking process.

The redesign aimed not only to refresh the visual appearance, but also to improve the overall user experience, making the app clearer, faster, and more accessible for users of different ages and technical backgrounds.

## 2. Problem Statement
The original version of the application faced several usability and design challenges:

- Outdated and visually heavy interface  
- Poor visual hierarchy and spacing issues affecting readability  
- Inconsistent colors, buttons, and UI components  
- Confusing and complex booking flow  
- No seat selection feature  
- Limited passenger booking options  
- Weak navigation and lack of clear feedback  
- Missing or unclear notifications  

These issues resulted in user confusion, longer booking time, and reduced trust in the application.
